Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Youâ€™ve opened the IDE in a temporary directory. ðŸŽ‰

This means that you launched the IDE without using the "Open" button on Learn or
without running `learn open` in the IDE terminal. Since opening the IDE this way
means you arenâ€™t working on a specific lab, we place you in a "temporary"
directory.

When youâ€™re in a temporary directory, the IDE WILL NOT save files or directories
created here ðŸ’¨ (even if you save them during your temporary session).

In other words, the "temporary" directory is just that: a temporary workspace.
If you want to store anything created here, be sure to back it up to a
repository on Github.

For the best IDE workflow, we recommend opening the IDE by clicking the "Open"
button from your lab page on Learn, or running `learn open`.

You can actually do that now by typing `learn open` in the terminal below. This
will open a new IDE workspace (aka a new IDE window) for your current lab, and
ðŸ’«ðŸ’«  your progress will be automatically saved to your GitHub ðŸ’«ðŸ’« so that we
can restore it should you revisit that lab in the IDE in the future.
